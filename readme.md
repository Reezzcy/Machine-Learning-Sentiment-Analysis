# Game Review Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews of the Clash of Clans game from the Google Play Store.

This analysis can help developers understand user feedback, identify areas for improvement, and enhance the overall user experience of the game. Preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization are used to improve the quality of the modelâ€™s input.
